*                                                                                                                                                           *
*    In spinning the wheel, you can land any of the three card types and the rule still applies whether you had money in the round or not.                  *
*                                                                                                                                                           *
*    While playing the game, if you are the current player of a round and had already spined the wheel and have money in the round you have                 *
*    the option of spinning again, buy a vowel or solve the puzzle, otherwise you forced to spin the wheel to attempt solving the puzzle.                   *

*    If a player has enough money in a round, they are able to buy a vowel, when buying a vowel, the total the cost of that vowel is the value              *
*    of the card you landed when you first spined the wheel for that round multiplied by the occurrence of the vowel in the word, that cost                 *
*    is then subtracted from your overall round total which lessen your chances of winning depending on how the other players are playing.                  *
*                                                                                                                                                           *
*    When a puzzle is solved the player who solved the puzzle gets to keep the money earned for that round and it gets added to their overall               *
*    game earning which is further used to determine who is the winner of the game.                                                                         *
*                                                                                                                                                           *
*    Once we complete the last round the game will display the player on screen and prompt the players if they want to continue the game,                   *
*    if a player selects ‘n’ they are removed from the game if the number of players is 2 and only player select ‘n’ then the game is cancelled.            *
*    Upon restarting the values will reset.                                                                                                                 *
